I'm a Statistican at the U.S. Census Bureau.

Prior to the Census, I was a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Labor Dynamics Institute](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/labor-dynamics-institute) , a research analyst at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas](https://www.dallasfed.org/research.aspx), and a research fellow at the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en).
