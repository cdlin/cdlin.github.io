Hi! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Economics at Cornell University. I'm currently a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Labor Dynamics Institute](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/labor-dynamics-institute).

Prior to attending Cornell, I was a research analyst at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas](https://www.dallasfed.org/research.aspx) and a research fellow at the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en).
